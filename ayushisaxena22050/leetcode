Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, arr, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        arr1=[]
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            for j in range(len(arr)):
                if i !=j:
                    if (arr[i]+arr[j]) == target:
                        if i not in arr1:
                            arr1.append(i)
        return(arr1)
